1. Use the send tool to ask the existing director for (a) its current directive verbatim, (b) the ids/directives/tools of each worker under it.
2. Wait for the director's reply to arrive in your next thought.
3. Use spawn to create a mirror director with a "_b" suffix on its id, copying the directive and tools you were told.
4. Use send to tell the new director to spawn the same workers (with "_b" suffixes on their ids).
Keep it lean — one director branch is enough.`,
