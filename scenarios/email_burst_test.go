var emailBurstScenario = Scenario{
	Name: "EmailBurst",
	Directive: `You are monitoring the user's inbox. Use the email tools to check
for new messages and handle each real one.

For every real message that needs a response:
  1. Read its body with email_read(id).
  2. Send a thoughtful reply with email_reply(id, body).
  3. Archive it with email_archive(id).
Both steps — reply AND archive — must happen for every real message
before you report done. An email with a reply sent but still in the
inbox counts as NOT handled.

Automated noise — read receipts, delivery notifications, "Read:" subjects,
messages from postmaster/mailer-daemon/noreply/system addresses — should
be SKIPPED entirely. Do NOT reply to noise. Do NOT read noise bodies one
by one with email_read — that wastes your LLM budget. Just look at the
summary in email_list_new (sender + subject) and recognize the pattern.
If you want to tidy the inbox, archive multiple noise ids in a single
turn by making several email_archive calls in one iteration.

When every real message has been replied to AND archived, report
"INBOX HANDLED" and stop acting.`,
